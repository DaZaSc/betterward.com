    <h2>Retrospective Benchmarks for Machine Intelligence</h2>
    
    <p class="section-intro">According to historical definitions of artificial general intelligence, have we achieved it?</p>
    
    <p>Six definitions, spanning 1997 to 2023, each treated as a testable specification. Each asked a different question about what machine intelligence would require. Each yields a different verdict when applied to frontier AI systems as of December 2025.</p>
